# GitHub Setup Commands

After creating your GitHub repository, run these commands:

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

Replace YOUR_USERNAME and YOUR_REPO_NAME with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

Example:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/johndoe/bound-hr-dashboard.git
git push -u origin main
```

After this, your code will be on GitHub and you can deploy easily to Vercel!
